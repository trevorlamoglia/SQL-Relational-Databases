# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

<!-- {Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.} -->

The purpose of this simple database will store names, ages, and birthdays for friends.

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.} -->

# Relational Database

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is a database, which is zero-configured, which means like other databases you do not need to configure it in your system.

The structure (table) that I created is a simple table that stores names, ages, and birthdays of friends.

# Development Environment

- Python 3.9 64-bit
- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub
- SQLite

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, and automatic memory management. Python is a very simple language, and has very straightforward syntax that programmers fall in love with including me.

# Future Work

* Add additional tables to the database and perform a join in the software between two of the tables.
