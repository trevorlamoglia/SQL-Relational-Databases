# Overview

By learning how to use SQL to access relational databases, I can get fast and convenient data retrieval. Knowledge of SQL is an essential skill for any software engineer to possess because the convenience and speed that SQL offers for managing data means that this programming language is one of the best for communicating with databases.

The purpose of this simple database will store names, ages, and birthdays for friends.

# Relational Database

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is a database, which is zero-configured, which means like other databases you do not need to configure it in your system.

The structure (table) that I created is a simple table that stores names, ingredients, prices, and calories of Filipino dishes.

# Development Environment

- Python 3.9 64-bit
- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub
- SQLite

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, and automatic memory management. Python is a very simple language, and has very straightforward syntax that programmers fall in love with including me.
